# Marshall-Mix-Design-M.B.M.K-

This software is written in Visual Basic language and it is a user-friendly tool to determine the optimum asphalt content in asphalt mixtures using the Marshall Mix design method.

The input file is a text file that has the labratury results for each sample as the follwoing:
